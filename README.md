# Vue.js Experiment Tracker

A modern, responsive experiment tracking application built with Vue 3 and PrimeVue for visualizing machine learning experiment data.

üöÄ **[Live Demo](https://oleh-khotymchuk.github.io/Experiment-tracker/)** | üìä **[Sample Data](public/sample-data.csv)**

## Features

### Core Functionality

- **CSV File Upload**: Upload experiment data from your machine
- **Experiment Management**: View and select experiments for visualization
- **Interactive Charts**: Line and scatter plots showing metric progression over training steps
- **Multi-Experiment Comparison**: Compare multiple experiments side-by-side
- **Real-time Filtering**: Search and filter experiments by name or metric
- **Chart Interactions**: Zoom, pan, and reset functionality with mouse and touch support

### UX & Scalability Features

- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- **Dark/Light Theme**: Toggle between light and dark modes with system preference detection
- **Loading States**: Visual feedback during file processing with progress indicators
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error messages and validation
- **Data Export**: Export selected experiment data as CSV
- **Efficient Rendering**: Optimized chart rendering for large datasets (1M+ data points)
- **Accessibility**: Full keyboard navigation and screen reader support
- **Performance**: Debounced updates and smart sampling for smooth interactions

## CSV Data Format

Your CSV file should contain the following columns:

- `experiment_id`: String identifying a particular training run (e.g., "exp_001")
- `metric_name`: Name of the tracked metric (e.g., "accuracy", "loss", "f1_score")
- `step`: Training step number (e.g., 1, 2, 3...)
- `value`: Metric value at that step (e.g., 0.85, 0.23)

### Sample Data

```csv
experiment_id,metric_name,step,value
exp_001,accuracy,1,0.75
exp_001,accuracy,2,0.82
exp_001,loss,1,0.65
exp_001,loss,2,0.45
```

A sample CSV file is available at `public/sample-data.csv` for testing.
